# Ores
TTB comes with two new ores - Vulcaanium and Amethyst.

## Amethyst
Amethyst is used to craft certain machines, but most importantly, it can be placed into a Tempite Container to power nearby machines.  
It can be found at Y<=40.
## Vulcaanium
Vulcaanium is used to craft some items such as the Eckspei Rod; however, it's mostly used to ascend machines into something more powerful.  
It can be found at Y<=32.
